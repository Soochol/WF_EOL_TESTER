- `configuration/hardware_config.yaml` - Hardware parameters

Configuration can be modified through the Configuration panel in the GUI or by editing the YAML files directly.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hardware Connection Errors**
   - Check hardware connections and power
   - Verify configuration settings in Hardware Control panel
   - Use manual connection test buttons

2. **Test Failures**
   - Ensure all hardware is connected and operational
   - Check test parameters in Configuration panel
   - Review test logs for specific error messages

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Close unused panels to reduce resource usage
   - Check system resources and available memory
   - Restart application if needed

### Log Files
System logs are displayed in real-time in various panel log areas and can be found in the application's log directory.
