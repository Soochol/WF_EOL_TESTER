## Backward Compatibility Verification

### ✅ Legacy API Preservation
All existing public APIs have been preserved:

```python
# Original EnhancedEOLTesterCLI class still works
cli = EnhancedEOLTesterCLI(use_case, hardware_facade, config_service)
await cli.run_interactive()

# All accessor methods preserved
console = cli.get_console()
formatter = cli.get_formatter()
validator = cli.get_validator()
hardware_manager = cli.get_hardware_manager()
usecase_manager = cli.get_usecase_manager()

# Legacy properties preserved
running_state = cli._running
cli._running = False
```

### ✅ Import Compatibility
All existing imports continue to work:

```python
from src.ui.cli.enhanced_eol_tester_cli import EnhancedEOLTesterCLI
from src.ui.cli.validation.input_validator import ValidationConstants
from src.ui.cli.rich_formatter import RichFormatter
```

### ✅ Functional Compatibility
- Menu validation using `ValidationConstants.MENU_CHOICES`
- Force validation using `ValidationConstants.FORCE_RANGE`  
- Rich formatting with `print_menu()`, `print_title()`, etc.
