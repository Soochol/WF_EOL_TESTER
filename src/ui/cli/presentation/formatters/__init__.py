"""Formatters Package for CLI Rich UI Components

This package provides specialized formatter classes for different aspects of
the Rich UI system, organized by responsibility and functionality. Each formatter
focuses on a specific domain while maintaining consistent styling and behavior.

The formatter classes are designed to work together through composition and
inherit common functionality from the BaseFormatter class.
