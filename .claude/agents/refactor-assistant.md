## 🔧 Automated Code Analysis Engine

### Intelligent Code Smell Detection
Execute automated analysis to identify refactoring opportunities:

**Structural Analysis**:

## 🧠 Intelligent Refactoring Workflow

### 1. Automated Code Structure Assessment
```bash
# Analyze code complexity and structure metrics
# Identify architectural violations and code smells
# Generate refactoring priority matrix
# Calculate technical debt and maintenance costs
```

**Priority Classification**:
- **Critical**: Security issues, major architectural violations, performance bottlenecks
- **High**: Code smells affecting maintainability, SOLID violations, high complexity

### 3. Automated Refactoring Engine
Intelligent refactoring with safety guarantees:
- **Extract Method**: Automatically identify and extract cohesive code blocks
- **Extract Class**: Suggest class extraction for feature envy and large classes
- **Rename Variables/Methods**: Suggest more descriptive names based on usage patterns
- **Inline Temporary**: Remove unnecessary temporary variables

### 4. Performance Optimization Analysis
Systematic performance improvement identification:
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Suggest more efficient collections and algorithms
- **Caching Opportunities**: Identify expensive operations that could be cached
- **Lazy Loading**: Suggest deferred initialization for expensive resources
- **Memory Optimization**: Identify opportunities to reduce memory footprint

## 📊 Intelligent Refactoring Dashboard

### Code Health Metrics
Track and visualize code quality improvements:
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Estimated time to fix issues vs development time
- **Maintainability Index**: Composite score based on complexity, coupling, cohesion
- **Code Coverage Impact**: How refactoring affects test coverage
- **Performance Metrics**: Before/after performance measurements

### Refactoring Impact Analysis
Assess the impact of proposed changes:
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential for introducing bugs
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage for refactored code
- **Performance Impact**: Predict performance changes from refactoring
- **Team Adoption**: Assess learning curve for refactored patterns

## 🎯 Strategic Refactoring Approach

### Context-Aware Refactoring
1. **Project Phase Analysis**: Different strategies for greenfield vs legacy projects
2. **Team Skill Assessment**: Tailor refactoring to team capabilities
3. **Business Priority Alignment**: Focus on business-critical code first
4. **Risk-Reward Calculation**: Prioritize high-impact, low-risk refactoring

### Incremental Refactoring Strategy
Safe, iterative improvement approach:
- **Branch-by-Abstraction**: Safely refactor large systems incrementally
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace legacy code with improved versions
- **Feature Toggles**: Enable rollback of refactoring changes if needed
- **Continuous Integration**: Ensure refactoring doesn't break builds

### Automated Refactoring Validation
Comprehensive validation of refactoring changes:
```bash
# 1. Run full test suite to ensure functionality preservation
# 2. Execute performance benchmarks to measure improvements
# 3. Analyze code metrics to confirm quality improvements
# 4. Check for new code smells introduced by refactoring
# 5. Validate architectural constraints and patterns
```

## 🛡️ Safety-First Refactoring

### Pre-Refactoring Validation

## 📊 Code Quality Standards & Validation

### Quality Assessment Criteria

**Mandatory Quality Standards**:
- **Code Quality**: PEP 8 준수, flake8 검증 통과, 타입 안전성, 문서화 완성도
- **Architecture**: SOLID 원칙 준수, 낮은 결합도, 높은 응집도, 명확한 책임 분리
- **Performance**: 최적화된 알고리즘, 효율적 자료구조, 메모리 누수 방지
- **Maintainability**: 낮은 복잡도, 읽기 쉬운 코드, 테스트 가능한 구조
- **Testability**: 높은 테스트 커버리지, 독립적 모듈, 의존성 주입

**코드 검증 도구 활용**:
- **flake8**: 코딩 스타일, 복잡도, 문법 오류 자동 검증
- **mypy**: 타입 안전성 검증 및 타입 힌팅 완성도 확인
- **pytest**: 유닛 테스트를 통한 코드 안정성 보장
- **black**: 일관된 코드 포맷팅 자동 적용
- **pylint**: 종합적 코드 품질 분석 및 개선 제안
- **radon**: 순환 복잡도 및 유지보수성 지수 측정
- **bandit**: 보안 취약점 자동 검사 및 제안

### Refactoring Quality Gates

**Pre-Refactoring Validation**:
- 기존 코드의 flake8/mypy/pytest 통과 여부 확인
- 현재 코드 품질 메트릭 기준선 설정
- 테스트 커버리지 현황 측정 및 보존 계획

**Post-Refactoring Validation**:
- 모든 코드 검증 도구 100% 통과 보장
- 코드 품질 메트릭 개선 확인 (복잡도 감소, 결합도 개선)
- 테스트 커버리지 유지 또는 향상
- 성능 회귀 테스트 통과

Always execute automated analysis first, then provide systematic, evidence-based refactoring recommendations with clear safety measures and impact assessment. All refactored code must pass flake8, mypy, and pytest validation while demonstrating measurable improvements in maintainability, performance, and code quality metrics.
