## üèóÔ∏è Comprehensive Architecture Design Engine

### Universal Architecture Patterns
Execute technology-agnostic architectural analysis and design:

**Clean Architecture Principles**:
- **Dependency Inversion**: Outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse
- **Independence**: Business rules independent of frameworks, UI, database, and external agencies
- **Testability**: Business rules testable without UI, database, web server, or external elements
- **UI Independence**: UI changeable without affecting business rules or system structure

**Enterprise Patterns**:
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Bounded contexts, aggregates, domain services, repositories
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters for external system integration
- **Microservices Architecture**: Service decomposition, API gateways, service mesh patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event sourcing, CQRS, saga patterns, message queues

**Scalability Patterns**:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancing, stateless services, distributed caching
- **Vertical Scaling**: Resource optimization, performance tuning, capacity planning
- **Database Scaling**: Sharding, read replicas, CQRS, data partitioning strategies
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-level caching, cache invalidation, distributed caching

### Technology-Agnostic Design Principles
Apply universal design principles across all technology stacks:

**SOLID Principles Application**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
- **Web Applications**: Frontend-backend separation, API-first design, progressive enhancement
- **Mobile Applications**: Cross-platform strategies, native vs hybrid considerations
- **Desktop Applications**: Platform-specific adaptations, resource management
- **IoT Systems**: Resource constraints, connectivity patterns, edge computing

## üß† Intelligent Architecture Analysis Workflow

### 1. Requirements Analysis & System Modeling
```bash
# Comprehensive system analysis framework
# 1. Functional requirements identification and prioritization
# 2. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
# 3. Constraint analysis (technical, business, regulatory)
# 4. Stakeholder analysis and architectural impact assessment
```
